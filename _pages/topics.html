        Behind the Breach: A Live, Interactive Look at Modern Hacks
      </h2><p>
        What does a hacker actually “see” when a user clicks a phishing link or scans a malicious QR code? How easy is it to
        clone your voice?
        In this interactive session, you see this first-hand as Mishaal Khan demonstrates this with live hacks. You'll see what happens when you click on ransomware and he may pick on you with some crafty social engineering tactics!
</p>      
    <p>
        The session goes beyond technology to show how publicly available information, casual interactions, and modern
        techniques like OSINT and voice cloning are used to build convincing attacks. Each demonstration is followed by clear,
        practical guidance so attendees understand what happened, why it worked, and how to stop similar attacks. No technical
        background required.
      </p>
      <p>
        Join Mishaal Khan, Certified Ethical Hacker, to witness real-time simulated
        scenarios. Get phished, look at breaches, experience advanced social engineering, and find out how publicly
        accessible information about your organization can be used against you by your competitors,
        nation-state attackers and disgruntled employees.
